<div align="left" >Welcome to the home page of our family farm,<img src="photo1.jpg" align="right"/><br/>
Sunny Acres, where there's always something<br/>
happening.  With the coming of fall, we're gearing up<br/>
for our big AutumnFest and Farm Show.  If you<br/>
haven't visited our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do <br/>
so before it gets torn down on November 5.  This<br/>
year's maze is bigger and better than ever.<br/>
<br/>
Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no<br/>
exception.  Schools and home-schooling parents<br/>
take an afternoon with us at our Petting Barn.  We<br/>
have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean<br/>
environment.  Kids can bottle feed the baby goats,<br/>
lambs, and calves while they learn about nature and<br/>
the farming life.  Please call ahead for large school<br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all<br/>
looking for a good fright.  Sunny Acres provides that too with another year of the<br/>
Haunted Maze.  Please plan on joining us during weekends in October or on<br/>
Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a <i>farm.</i>  Our Farm Shop is always open with<br/>
reasonable prices and great produce.  Save even more money by picking your own<br/>
fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.<br/>
<br/>
We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.<br/>
